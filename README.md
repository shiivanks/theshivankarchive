# The Shivank Archive
**Your Personal Knowledge Base & Open Learning Resource**

Welcome to The Shivank Archive GitHub repository! This project stores the foundational Obsidian vault for my personal and ever-growing online knowledge base, meticulously curated and openly accessible to everyone.

## What is The Shivank Archive?
More than just a collection of notes, The Shivank Archive is my digital brain, a living compendium of everything I've learned, studied, and continue to explore. From course notes and technical deep-dives to philosophical musings and practical guides, this archive is designed to be:

* **A Personal Reference**: My go-to source for recalling information, understanding complex topics, and building upon existing knowledge.
* **A Continuous Learning Journal**: Documenting my ongoing educational journey, capturing insights as they happen.
* **A Publicly Accessible Resource**: Published online for anyone on the internet to freely access, explore, and utilize for their own learning. Think of it as a shared library of documented understanding.

## Why is it on GitHub?
This repository holds the raw Markdown files that constitute the entire Shivank Archive. By keeping it public on GitHub, I aim to:

* **Ensure Transparency**: Showcase the underlying structure and content of the published website.
* **Facilitate Version Control**: Track changes, revisions, and additions to the knowledge base over time.
* **Obsidian Integration**: Provide the core files for anyone interested in exploring the vault directly within Obsidian.

## How to Use This Repository
While the best way to consume the content is via the beautifully rendered website [The Shivank Archive](https://www.example.com/), this repository allows you to:

* **Browse Raw Notes**: Navigate through the folders and Markdown files to see the unformatted content.
* **Clone the Vault**: If you're an Obsidian user, you can clone this repository to your local machine and open it directly as an Obsidian vault. This gives you full control to explore, search, and even link to my notes within your own local Obsidian environment.
* **Inspect Structure**: Understand how the information is organized and interlinked.

Feel free to explore, learn, and leverage the knowledge within The Shivank Archive. If you find something particularly useful or have a question, you can reach out via my website or connect on <linkedin>.
